This is a project in which I compare the NCAA statistics, of players drafted between 2000-2010, of those did make allstar teams versus those who did not.

<br> This is a full-cycle data analysis project, including

<br> (1) data extraction, off of basketball-reference.com and sports-reference.com,
<br> (2) data validation, to make sure I was getting the right player's statistics,
<br> (3) data cleaning, especially when cleaning names to search for player data, and
<br> (4) data visualization, to compare the college stats for both groups of players.
